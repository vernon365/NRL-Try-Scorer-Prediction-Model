# NRL Try Scorer Prediction using Machine Learning
Model Still Under Development

This project uses machine learning and neural networks (TensorFlow + Keras) to predict NRL try scorers based on past performance and team statistics. The pipeline includes data wrangling, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction visualization.
