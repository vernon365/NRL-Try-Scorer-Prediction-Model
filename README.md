# NRL Try Scorer Prediction using Machine Learning
# Model Still Under Development

This project uses machine learning and neural networks (TensorFlow + Keras) to predict NRL try scorers based on past performance and team statistics. The pipeline includes data wrangling, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and prediction visualization.

---

##Project Features

- End-to-end ML pipeline using real NRL data
- Data wrangling and feature extraction with Pandas
- One-hot encoding and normalization
- Neural network model with dropout and L2 regularization
- Binary classification for predicting player tries
- Visualization of predictions vs. actual outcomes

---

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib
